<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>Personal Introduction</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Prescott Grigsby and I'm from San Diego, CA. Currently I'm pursuing my bachelors in computer science which is why I'm taking a web development course. In my free time, some things I like to do are:

    <ul>
        <li>Develop games and websites</li>
        <li>Play games with friends</li>
        <li>Watch shows with family</li>
      </ul>

Currently I have no pets, but I am constantly awaiting the day I feel responsible enough to end up getting a cat... 
</p>


<h3>History & The Future</h3>
<p> In the past, I've taken many different CS courses that 
    have helped to not only refine my work, but also motivate me to do more. I found out from one of my earlier class that I really enjoy working with API's, and pulling data from sources that can be displayed 
    elsewhere. In high school I took AP CS, and it was a really fun and engaging class for me that helped to spark the path I'm on today. 

    Unfortunately when it comes to college, I kinda had to backtrack in terms of difficulty which caused me to lose some of that motivation to pursue things, since I lost the feeling of improvement. Thankfully though, web development has helped to fix that since 
    it is different enough from just coding in a typical language that it intrigues me. I look forward to furthering my understandment of development, and being able to apply these skills to the real world.
